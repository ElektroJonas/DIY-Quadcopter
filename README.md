# Quadcopter Built from Scratch

This project contains all the materials used in building a quadcopter drone. It was part of a project course in electrical engineering and embedded systems at Uppsala University, where we spent a portion of the semester designing and constructing a quadcopter from scratch using off-the-shelf components and some interesting control algorithms! ðŸš€

### Control System  
The control system consists of two main components: **Attitude Control** and **Altitude Control**.  

- **Attitude Control** (angle relative to the ground plane) is implemented using a cascaded PID controller with a Kalman filter and an internal rate control loop. It relies on a low-cost MEMS sensor (gyroscope/accelerometer) for angle estimation.  
- **Altitude Control** is managed using a pressure sensor in combination with the MEMS sensor for attitude estimation, supplemented by a Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) algorithm for improved stability and accuracy.   

The control system was implemented on an ESP32 microcontroller, utilizing the ESP-NOW protocol for wireless communication.
